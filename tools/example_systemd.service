# The idea is to deploy this twice, adapting the names and port in the Exec*
# directives. Mounting the videos is technically optional, since it's faster to
# serve them directly through the webserver in front, but it's nice for testing.

# To get downtime free deployments, the services should be restarted individually
# with a wait and/or check in between.
